This is a small (94x51 mm) standalone FPGA board 
for education, research and general purpose, with a full 
featured selection of chips which I all wanted on
a low-cost PCB, but haven't found on the market.
It's open source and open hardware because if it is
good for our development of [f32c](http://github.com/f32c/f32c) SOC,
it should be also good to other projects.

ULX4M is sufficiently equipped to
emulate [Amiga](https://github.com/emard/Minimig_ECS) retro
computer and run its games, but can do much more like
running [Linux](https://twitter.com/fpga_dave/status/1053290842809683968).
